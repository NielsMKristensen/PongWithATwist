# Pong With A Twist

## Introduction
Pong With A Twist was created during project week (week 3) of the Ironhack Web Development Course, and the task was to create a game via javascript html and css.

This is my first ever game created and i hope you will enjoy it and that it doesn't contain that many bugs.

Pong With A Twist was inspired by the game PONG and basically is a single player game that bounces a ball (emoji) off a wall and the player's task is to prevent the ball from going into the fire using a paddle.

## How to play the game.
The game is published on git pages and can be reached using the following link.
